# Playwright Framework Project Demonstration

This project demonstrates a robust Playwright testing framework using multiple approaches and tools, including JavaScript with Mocha, TypeScript, and Cucumber BDD.

## Project Highlights

- Initial framework built using **JavaScript** with the **Mocha** test framework.
- One complete **end-to-end test case using TypeScript** to showcase TypeScript integration.
- **Cucumber BDD** framework integrated with a few demonstration test cases.
- Easy to set up and run in **VS Code** or any other preferred editor.
